Outcome: [Dashboard](https://github.com/remytr/Ecommerce_Products/blob/main/PowerBI%20Export.pdf) providing analysis on which inventory to re-stock for an e-commerce business in the UK in February 2023.

A fictional e-commerce business has been acquired and the acquiring company wants to maximise profit for the e-commerce business. They aim to do this by stocking the most profitable inventory. Given data regarding product details, product cost, product price, etc.

### Process 
1. Data exploration in Google Cloud BigQuery.
2. Data Cleaning.
3. Data Visualisation in Power BI.

### Result
- Based on the analysis, I recommended that Men's Bib Shorts (sizes S and M) and Women's Tights (sizes S and L), should be the products that should have a drastic increase in inventory to maximise profit.
- Area chart shows Women's Tights and Men's Bib Shorts as the most profitable products over the previous 6 months (Aug 2022 - Feb 2023).
- Treemap goes into more detail about which sizes of the products are generating the most profit.
- Even though the profit growth rate for Half-Finger Gloves is high it is not forecasted to generate more profit than Women's Tights in the following 6 months.
